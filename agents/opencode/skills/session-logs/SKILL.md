## OpenCode Runtime Notes

This skill is installed as an OpenCode-native `SKILL.md`. For runtime-backed
helpers, prefer the shared ai-agents-skills runtime root and the
`AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT` override instead of assuming a Codex-specific runtime
path.

# Session Logs

Use this skill to recover prior context from local artifacts.

## Search order

1. `~/.codex/memories/`
2. `~/.codex/history.jsonl`
3. `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/*.jsonl`
4. `~/.codex/log/`
5. `~/.codex/archived_sessions/` and `~/.codex/session_index.jsonl` if those artifacts exist
6. `~/.openclaw/agents/.../sessions/` only as an optional legacy fallback when that path exists and the task specifically benefits from it

## When to use

- "What did we say before?"
- "Find the previous discussion about X"
- "Search older sessions"
- "What did Codex decide last time?"

## Tools

- use `functions.exec_command`
- prefer `rg` for filename and content filtering
- use `jq` for structured extraction from JSONL transcripts

## Useful patterns

Search memories first:

```bash
rg -n "phrase" ~/.codex/memories
```

Search local Codex sessions:

```bash
rg -l "phrase" ~/.codex/sessions ~/.codex/history.jsonl
```

Search optional archived Codex sessions:

```bash
rg -l "phrase" ~/.codex/archived_sessions ~/.codex/session_index.jsonl
```

Extract assistant text from Codex session JSONL:

```bash
jq -r 'select(.type == "response_item" and .payload.type == "message" and .payload.role == "assistant") | .payload.content[]? | select(.type == "output_text" or .type == "input_text") | .text' <session>.jsonl
```

Extract user text from Codex session JSONL:

```bash
jq -r 'select(.type == "response_item" and .payload.type == "message" and .payload.role == "user") | .payload.content[]? | select(.type == "input_text" or .type == "output_text") | .text' <session>.jsonl
```

Legacy OpenClaw fallback:

```bash
rg -l "phrase" ~/.openclaw/agents
```

## Interruption triage

When diagnosing an interrupted Codex turn, inspect lifecycle metadata before
reading or quoting conversation content:

- A `task_started` followed by `task_complete` is a normal completed turn.
- A `turn_aborted` record confirms that Codex handled an interrupt, but does
  not by itself identify the key, signal, UI action, or actor that caused it.
- If a later task starts without either terminal record, classify the earlier
  turn as an abnormal lifecycle gap. Do not infer Ctrl+C, a subprocess signal,
  or large output as the cause without separate evidence.
- Process IDs, parent/session/process-group IDs, controlling-TTY state, event
  types, timestamps, levels, and logger targets are safe first-line evidence.
  Do not print raw argv, environment values, tool inputs/outputs, or message
  bodies merely to identify a lifecycle boundary.
- For a missing child or signal 9, correlate kernel OOM records and cgroup
  memory events by timestamp before blaming terminal input. Name the recorded
  OOM victim separately from any inferred effect on the Codex turn.
- Treat plaintext TUI logs as sensitive. Keep their directory owner-only and
  quote only the minimum redacted diagnostic lines needed.

Separate confirmed observations from causal inferences, and label any missing
terminal evidence as incomplete analysis.

## Rules

- Prefer `.codex` memories and `.codex` session artifacts before any legacy path.
- If `archived_sessions/` or `session_index.jsonl` exist, treat them as Codex-native sources before legacy OpenClaw logs.
- Use `~/.openclaw/...` only when that legacy path exists and is actually needed.
- Quote only the lines needed.
- Include the source path when it helps verification.
- If memory notes and raw session logs disagree, say so.
- Do not assume `~/.openclaw/agents/` exists locally; check first.
