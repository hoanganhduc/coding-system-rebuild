# Local compute throttle contract

When heavy computation must run on the local machine (remote offload
unavailable: cloud minutes exhausted, broker down, credit unverifiable),
run it under this contract. Its purpose is to make overload shutdowns
impossible: a research session on a small box (2-4 cores) has been killed
by load spikes from concurrent unthrottled compute — every rule below maps
to one such incident.

## Hard rules

1. ONE local compute job at a time, machine-wide. Enforce with a lockfile
   created atomically (`os.open(path, O_CREAT|O_EXCL)`) under
   `tempfile.gettempdir()` — portable across OSes; a second runner must
   abort, not queue. Write the PID inside and treat a lock whose PID is
   dead as stale.
2. SINGLE-PROCESS execution. No `multiprocessing.Pool` (terminate-hangs
   orphan workers), no `-j` above 2, no nested parallelism. Leave at least
   half the cores permanently free for the interactive session and agents.
3. Deprioritize (per platform):
   - Linux: `nice -n 19` + `ionice -c3`.
   - macOS: `nice -n 19` + `taskpolicy -c background` (no ionice).
   - Windows: idle priority class — `start /LOW /B ...` or, from Python,
     `psutil.Process().nice(psutil.IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS)`.
4. Per-config watchdog, portable form: run each unit as a CHILD SUBPROCESS
   with `subprocess.run(..., timeout=<cap>)` and kill on expiry — this works
   on every OS and also isolates memory. (`signal.alarm` is a Unix-only
   optimization; do not rely on it in shared drivers.) Memory ceiling:
   `resource.setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS, ...)` on Unix; on Windows monitor the
   child's RSS via `psutil` and kill above the cap (~60-75% of free RAM).
5. Load guard inside the runner, portable form: `os.getloadavg()` on
   Linux/macOS (1-min load > ~0.75x core count => sleep >= 2 min and
   re-check); on Windows (no loadavg) use `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)`
   sustained above ~75% as the equivalent signal. Check between units, at
   least once a minute.

## Chunked, resumable execution

- Split every suite into time-budgeted chunks (~10-15 min). A chunk ends
  CLEANLY at its budget: append-only JSONL checkpoints per config, plus a
  persisted pending list (grid minus done) so the next chunk resumes
  exactly. A session restart then costs at most one chunk.
- Run chunks from a detached trickle loop with a STOP sentinel file for
  clean shutdown, and a log the orchestrator can poll: `setsid nohup ... &`
  on Linux/macOS; on Windows, `start /B` a `pythonw` loop or register a
  low-priority Scheduled Task. The sentinel + JSONL checkpoint pattern is
  identical on every OS. Long suites trickle over days by design; that is
  the intended behavior, not a defect.

## Orchestrator duties (the research loop side)

- Concurrency picture at any moment: 1 nice'd compute chunk (background)
  + 1 reasoning agent + 1 light verification gate, MAXIMUM. Verifier
  machine re-runs are sample-sized locally; full re-verification waits for
  remote compute.
- Task packets must state the budget: "local checks under ~5 minutes;
  anything heavier goes through the throttled runner queue or is deferred
  with a written spec." Agents must never launch ad-hoc heavy processes.
- Heartbeats/monitors kill runaways and orphans — including processes
  owned by OTHER users blocking cores (use sudo where permitted; verify
  ownership before killing), and check the queue is advancing.
- If the box still approaches overload (load > core count for minutes),
  stop the queue via the sentinel first; investigate before resuming.

## Choosing the venue

Use the unified broker rather than a venue-specific shortcut. Its recommended
order is `local > Kaggle > Modal > Hetzner > GitHub Actions`, while an explicitly
configured valid order keeps local first and may reorder or omit unique remote
lanes. This legacy single-process throttle remains a safe
fallback when the broker is unavailable; the broker's own local lane instead
computes a safe worker count under its self-preservation policy. Remote lanes must
pass their own readiness and safety gates (Kaggle GPU-hours when GPU is requested,
Modal USD, Hetzner EUR plus teardown, or GitHub Actions minutes). If no adequate
lane passes, defer with an exact pending list. Never "just run it" unthrottled
locally: that is how sessions die.
