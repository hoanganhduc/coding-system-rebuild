## OpenCode Runtime Notes

This skill is installed as an OpenCode-native `SKILL.md`. For runtime-backed
helpers, prefer the shared ai-agents-skills runtime root and the
`AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT` override instead of assuming a Codex-specific runtime
path.

# Autonomous Research Loop Runtime

This companion skill provides offline helper scripts for the
`autonomous-research-loop` ledger contract.

It is intentionally runtime-backed and should be installed only for targets that
support runtime skill helpers. It is not an OpenClaw skill-file target.

## Commands

From a configured ai-agents-skills runtime, prefer:

```bash
bash "$AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT/run_skill.sh" skills/autonomous-research-loop-runtime/run_autonomous_research_loop.sh selftest
```

Common commands:

```bash
bash "$AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT/run_skill.sh" skills/autonomous-research-loop-runtime/run_autonomous_research_loop.sh init --dir research/run --goal "..." --success-criteria "..."
```

```bash
bash "$AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT/run_skill.sh" skills/autonomous-research-loop-runtime/run_autonomous_research_loop.sh append-iteration --dir research/run --mode bounded-research --objective "Check evidence gaps" --decision continue
```

```bash
bash "$AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT/run_skill.sh" skills/autonomous-research-loop-runtime/run_autonomous_research_loop.sh validate --dir research/run
```

```bash
bash "$AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT/run_skill.sh" skills/autonomous-research-loop-runtime/run_autonomous_research_loop.sh status --dir research/run
```

The helper is authoritative for local ledger and iteration-budget invariants.
It rejects appends after `max_iterations`, rejects continuing decisions on the
final allowed iteration, rejects early `stop` records that lack a valid
proof/success artifact, and validation fails ledgers whose spent iteration
count, iteration records, terminal decisions, and running status disagree.

The runtime also exposes force-management and enforcement subcommands used by the
autoloop wiring (not part of the normal ledger flow): `arm` / `disarm` /
`active` register, deregister, and list an active loop; `done` is the read-only
stop-condition arbiter; `hook-check` is the cross-platform Stop-hook check that
the installed Claude `hooks.Stop` entry invokes directly (it reads the hook JSON
on stdin, honors `AUTOLOOP_DISABLE` / `AUTOLOOP_DRIVER` / the `stop_hook_active`
re-entrancy payload, and exits 2 only when an active loop is unfinished, fail-open
otherwise); `agent-cmd` prints the per-provider headless one-iteration command
(offline PATH probe, no execution); and `drive` is the cross-platform headless
driver that runs one iteration per loop until `done` (the POSIX
`autoloop_driver.sh` is a thin shim that delegates to it).

## Truly autonomous execution on every install target

A chat session cannot run hundreds of loop iterations: context windows and turn
boundaries end it. Unattended execution therefore uses `drive`, which respawns a
FRESH headless agent session per iteration against the on-disk loop files and
owns the stop conditions itself. Exactly one of `--cmd` or `--provider` selects
the iteration command; with `--provider` the runtime builds the standard
one-iteration invocation for that install target:

| Provider (target) | Iteration command built by `agent-cmd` / `drive --provider` |
|---|---|
| `claude` | `claude -p "<prompt>" --dangerously-skip-permissions` |
| `codex` | `codex exec --full-auto "<prompt>"` |
| `deepseek` | `codewhale exec --auto "<prompt>"` (falls back to `codewhale-tui`, `deepseek`) |
| `opencode` | `opencode run "<prompt>"` |
| `copilot` | `copilot -p "<prompt>" --allow-all-tools` |
| `antigravity` | `gemini --yolo -p "<prompt>"` |

`<prompt>` is the standard one-iteration contract: read `recovery.md` and the
ledger, execute the single recorded next action under the loop policy, verify
independently, append exactly one iteration record, refresh the recovery files,
exit. Inspect it with `agent-cmd --provider <p> --dir <loop> --print-prompt`.
OpenClaw is not a driver target (no local agent CLI); drive its loops from a
supported provider instead.

Start an unattended run (POSIX):

```bash
bash "$AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT/run_skill.sh" skills/autonomous-research-loop-runtime/run_autonomous_research_loop.sh drive --dir research/run --provider claude
```

On Windows use `%AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT%\run_skill.bat ... run_autonomous_research_loop.bat drive --dir research\run --provider codex`.
Wrap with `nohup`, `systemd-run`, or Task Scheduler for multi-day runs.

Driver behavior:

- Each iteration's output is captured under `<loop>/driver_logs/`.
- Credit/quota outages (rate limit, 429, out of credits, usage limit, billing)
  detected in a FAILED iteration's output do not count as failures: the driver
  pauses `--quota-backoff` seconds (default 900) and retries, honoring the
  pause-and-wait-for-credits policy. `--max-quota-waits N` caps consecutive
  waits (default 0 = wait indefinitely).
- Genuine failures stop the run after `--max-failures` consecutive occurrences.
- Stop conditions are re-checked every cycle by the `done` arbiter: iteration
  cap, wall/token/USD budgets, terminal ledger status, `STOP_REQUESTED` and
  `PAUSE` sentinels, and `require_user_stop_only`.
- Exit codes: 0 stopped cleanly (`done`), 3 max failures, 4 runtime error,
  5 quota waits exhausted, 6 provider binary unavailable.
- Overrides: `AAS_AUTOLOOP_BIN_<PROVIDER>` (binary), `AAS_AUTOLOOP_ARGS_<PROVIDER>`
  (argument template; `{prompt}`/`{dir}` placeholders), `AAS_AUTOLOOP_CMD_<PROVIDER>`
  (full shell template; `{prompt}` is inserted shell-quoted and also exported as
  `AUTOLOOP_PROMPT`).

The default flag sets grant the agent full tool autonomy, which unattended
research requires; run loops only in workspaces you trust the agent to modify,
and prefer a dedicated project root. Interactive forcing is separate: on Claude
the installed `hooks.Stop` entry blocks turn-end while an ARMED loop (`arm
--dir <loop> --root <project>`) is unfinished; the other targets have no Stop
hook and are governed by the driver alone.

For an early proof/success stop, at least one `--evidence-id ID` must resolve to
`proof_artifacts/ID.json` inside the loop directory. Early proof/success stop
reasons are `success`, `success_criteria_met`, `proof`, `proof_found`,
`found_proof`, and `proved`. The artifact id must be 1-128 characters of
letters, digits, underscore, hyphen, or dot and must start with a letter or
digit. The JSON artifact must include:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "id": "proof-artifact-1",
  "artifact_type": "lean",
  "machine_checkable": true,
  "target": "the theorem or success target",
  "proof_path": "proofs/theorem.lean",
  "checker": {
    "name": "lean",
    "status": "passed"
  }
}
```

The helper checks that the artifact exists, `id` matches the evidence id,
`schema_version` is `1.0`, `machine_checkable` is `true`, `artifact_type` is
one of `lean`, `coq`, `isabelle`, `agda`, `sagemath`, `python-verifier`, or
`external-verifier`, `checker.name` is non-empty, `checker.status` is `passed`,
`target` is non-empty, and `proof_path` is an existing relative file within
the loop directory. It does not run Lean, Coq, SageMath, or another checker
itself.

On Windows, use the installed runtime runner with the native launcher target:

```bat
%AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT%\run_skill.bat skills/autonomous-research-loop-runtime/run_autonomous_research_loop.bat selftest
```

```powershell
& "$env:AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT\run_skill.ps1" skills/autonomous-research-loop-runtime/run_autonomous_research_loop.ps1 selftest
```

## Guarantees

The helper:

- uses only the Python standard library
- does not require network access for ledger, arbiter, probe, or selftest work
- does not install packages
- does not start servers
- does not write configuration outside the selected loop directory (the driver
  additionally writes iteration logs under the loop's `driver_logs/`)
- ledger subcommands, `done`, `hook-check`, `agent-cmd`, and `selftest` never
  call Codex, Claude, Copilot, DeepSeek, or other provider CLIs; only `drive`
  executes the iteration command the operator selected (via `--cmd` or
  `--provider`), which is the entire point of the headless driver
- does not spawn subagents itself (agents launched by `drive` may)

Use the canonical `autonomous-research-loop` skill for orchestration policy and
this helper only for local ledger mechanics. This helper validates that an
early proof stop points to a passed machine-checkable proof artifact record; it
does not independently validate the semantic truth of the proof.

## Recommended templates

When this skill is involved, consider these workflow templates (install via
the `workflow-templates` artifact profile, or `--with-deps` to pull backing skills):

- `autonomous-research-loop-runbook` -- Bounded autonomous research-loop runbook with four stop conditions, single-path solving, mandatory cross-agent verification, fresh-agent backtracking, and Modal/GitHub Actions credit-gated heavy-compute offload.
