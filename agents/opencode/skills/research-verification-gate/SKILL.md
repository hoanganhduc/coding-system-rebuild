## OpenCode Runtime Notes

This skill is installed as an OpenCode-native `SKILL.md`. For runtime-backed
helpers, prefer the shared ai-agents-skills runtime root and the
`AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT` override instead of assuming a Codex-specific runtime
path.

# Research Verification Gate

Use this as the last gate before claiming a research output is ready.

## Required checks

- the stated scope was actually answered
- important claims still have supporting evidence
- time-sensitive facts include concrete dates when needed
- remaining gaps are disclosed
- `incomplete analysis` is used when material scope is still unchecked

## Output contract

Produce a short visible section titled `Delivery Check`.

Include:

- `Status` — `READY` or `NOT READY`
- `Confirmed` — the key checks that passed
- `Gaps` — anything still blocking delivery
- `Next step` — deliver now or fix specific gaps first

Use the checklist in `references/checklist.md`.

## Guardrails

- do not silently downgrade a blocker into a caveat
- if material scope is unchecked, require `incomplete analysis`
- keep the gate short and concrete
