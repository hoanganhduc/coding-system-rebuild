## OpenCode Runtime Notes

This skill is installed as an OpenCode-native `SKILL.md`. For runtime-backed
helpers, prefer the shared ai-agents-skills runtime root and the
`AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT` override instead of assuming a Codex-specific runtime
path.

# Database Lookup

Use this skill when the user wants structured data from public databases such as:

- compounds, drugs, assays, targets
- genes, proteins, pathways, variants, expression resources
- clinical trials and disease resources
- patents and regulatory datasets
- economic and fiscal data

## Intended role in Codex

This skill is primarily:
- a routing/reference skill
- a database-selection guide
- a source for query strategy and identifier mapping

It is **not** a replacement for:
- `zotero` for library lookup
- `paper-lookup` for literature discovery
- `source-research` for general synthesis

## High-value references

Start with:

- `references/pubchem.md`
- `references/chembl.md`
- `references/bindingdb.md`
- `references/uniprot.md`
- `references/reactome.md`
- `references/ensembl.md`
- `references/ncbi-gene.md`
- `references/gtex.md`
- `references/clinvar.md`
- `references/clinicaltrials.md`
- `references/opentargets.md`
- `references/fred.md`
- `references/treasury.md`
- `references/uspto.md`

## Routing guidance

- Use `database-lookup` when the user is asking for data records or identifiers.
- Use `paper-lookup` when the user is asking for papers.
- Use `source-research` when the user wants broader explanation or synthesis.
