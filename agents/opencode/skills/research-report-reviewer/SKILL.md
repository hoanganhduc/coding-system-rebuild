## OpenCode Runtime Notes

This skill is installed as an OpenCode-native `SKILL.md`. For runtime-backed
helpers, prefer the shared ai-agents-skills runtime root and the
`AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT` override instead of assuming a Codex-specific runtime
path.

# Research Report Reviewer

Use this after a draft exists and before presenting research as final.

## What to inspect

- unsupported or weakly supported claims
- missing dates or stale-time ambiguity
- scope drift relative to the original question
- places where observation and inference are blended together
- overconfident language that should be hedged or marked `incomplete analysis`

## Output contract

Start with a visible section titled `Review Findings`.

Then give:

- `Verdict` — `BLOCK`, `FLAG`, or `PASS`
- `Findings` — the highest-signal issues first
- `Repairs` — the minimum changes needed before delivery

If there are no issues, say so explicitly and keep the pass short.

Use `references/reviewer-prompt.md` as the detailed checklist.

## Guardrails

- findings first, summary second
- focus on research quality, not copyediting
- prefer the smallest repair that makes the draft defensible
- if a gap cannot be closed, require explicit disclosure instead of pretending it is solved
