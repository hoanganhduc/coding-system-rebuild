## OpenCode Runtime Notes

This skill is installed as an OpenCode-native `SKILL.md`. For runtime-backed
helpers, prefer the shared ai-agents-skills runtime root and the
`AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT` override instead of assuming a Codex-specific runtime
path.

# Paper Lookup

Use this skill for external literature discovery and metadata lookup.

## Important routing boundary

Do **not** replace the existing library-first workflow.

Keep this order:
- `zotero` first for paper/library retrieval
- `calibre` second for review tasks needing a local document
- `paper-lookup` for external metadata/discovery
- `getscipapers_requester` for actual external retrieval when needed

## Good use cases

- find papers on a topic
- resolve a DOI or PMID
- check whether a paper has an open-access location
- search major literature APIs before retrieval

## High-value references

- `references/pubmed.md`
- `references/pmc.md`
- `references/arxiv.md`
- `references/biorxiv.md`
- `references/crossref.md`
- `references/openalex.md`
- `references/semantic-scholar.md`
- `references/unpaywall.md`
