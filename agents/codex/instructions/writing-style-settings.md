# Writing Style Settings

This is the canonical, general writing-style policy for reusable writing tasks.
It applies to writing-producing workflows unless a higher-priority instruction,
project rule, or approved domain overlay says otherwise.

## Scope

Use this policy for drafts, research notes, reports, reviews, digests, role
prompts, summaries, and other user-facing prose. Code style and repository
conventions still come from the target project first.

## Precedence

Apply writing instructions in this order:

1. active system, developer, project, and user instructions for the current
   task;
2. accepted current-task style additions that do not conflict with higher
   priority instructions;
3. skill-specific task instructions;
4. active domain overlays;
5. this general policy;
6. approved reusable session additions mapped to stable active requirement IDs.

Persisted but unapproved session candidates are not active policy.

## Activation

Every writing-producing workflow must identify the active style profile before
final prose is delivered. A finalizable workflow must record at least
`style_profile_ref`, `policy_hash`, `active_overlays`, `active_requirement_ids`,
and `style_applied`.

## Context To Inspect

Before drafting or revising, inspect the relevant draft, notes, source material,
prior examples, templates, house style, venue instructions, and supplied
formatting constraints. If expected context is absent, say so and state the
assumption instead of inventing a house style.

## Claim And Evidence Discipline

Keep claims separate from evidence, assumptions, caveats, and open gaps. Do not
make unsupported claims sound more certain. Preserve caveats unless the user
explicitly asks to change them.

Before substantive drafting or rewriting that could change an argument, extract
the atomic claims and map each substantive claim to its support. Freeze the
claims that must remain unchanged and list any claims that the author allows to
evolve. After revision, audit every added, removed, strengthened, weakened, or
unsupported claim, together with every change to a caveat or support mapping.
Remove unsupported additions or obtain explicit acceptance for them. A revision
is not ready until its caveats and limitations still match the intended
argument and the claim-level changes are visible.

Purely mechanical edits that cannot alter a claim, such as correcting a typo or
normalizing whitespace, do not require a claim ledger.

## Audience And Purpose

Choose wording for the reader and task. Prefer direct explanations over
decorative phrasing. Keep background only when it helps the reader understand
the contribution, decision, or result.

## Structure

Organize prose so the reader sees the purpose before the details. Use headings,
short paragraphs, and local transitions where they reduce ambiguity. Avoid
duplicated explanations and unused definitions.

Give each paragraph one main job. A paragraph break should mark a new step in
the explanation rather than serve as decoration.

## Sentence-Level Defaults

Use short, precise sentences. Prefer common terminology over private names. When
a non-common concept is necessary, define it before first use and explain its
role briefly.

## Grammar And Scope

An opening participial phrase must modify the grammatical subject of its main
clause. If the intended actor differs, replace the phrase with an explicit
clause; otherwise the sentence attributes the action to the wrong object.

Use commas to distinguish a nonrestrictive clause from a restrictive clause.
Set off information that can be removed without changing the referent, and do
not set off information that selects the referent. Determine the distinction
from meaning rather than mechanically from `that` versus `which`. Insert a
comma when its absence would make scope ambiguous or place two mathematical
symbols next to one another without a readable boundary.

Choose `a` or `an` by the pronunciation of the following word, symbol,
abbreviation, or initialism, not by its first written letter.

## Research-Paper Sentence Openings

For research papers, research notes, reports, and reviews, write full
grammatical sentences. Avoid command-style sentence openings such as "Set",
"Put", "Define", "Choose", "Write", "Consider", "Apply", "Observe", "Denote",
"Take", "Fix", "Say", "Project", "Work", or "Relabel" when a declarative
sentence gives the same meaning. Standard discipline-specific setup or reminder
openings, such as "Let ... be ...", "Suppose ...", "Assume ...", and
"Recall ...", are allowed when they are the clearest form.

## Formatting Defaults

Use formatting only when it helps scan or verify the content. Keep lists
parallel. Prefer inline equations or identifiers unless display formatting is
needed for readability or mathematical importance.

## LaTeX Source Preservation And Line Discipline

These rules apply to every writing workflow that creates or edits a `.tex`
file, regardless of subject, genre, template, or downstream venue.

Never place prose from more than one complete sentence on the same physical
source line. A single sentence may occupy one source line or span several when
emphasis or readability requires it. Apply the same line discipline to active
prose and prose preserved inside LaTeX comments. This is a source-code rule
only: it does not control line wrapping, sentence layout, or pagination in the
generated PDF.

When revising an existing `.tex` file, do not delete source merely because it
is no longer needed. Comment out the superseded or unused lines and add the
replacement separately, so the previous source remains visible and can be
restored later if needed. Delete content from a `.tex` file only when deletion
is genuinely necessary for the requested result. This content-preservation
rule does not prohibit deleting a whole unnecessary file; file deletion remains
subject to the ordinary scope and safety rules for filesystem changes.

Removal, rather than comment preservation, is mandatory when confidentiality,
privacy, security, licensing, anonymization or redaction, or unsafe executable
content requires it. Remove only the affected content and preserve the
remainder when doing so is safe.

## Uncertainty And Gaps

State material assumptions, unchecked evidence, and blocked inspection. Use
`incomplete analysis` when material scope remains uninspected.

## Session Updates

When the user gives a new durable writing requirement, apply it to the active
task if compatible with higher-priority instructions. Capture it as a
`pending record` with source phrase, normalized rule, scope, conflicts, approval
state, and proposed destination. Do not promote it into canonical policy without
explicit approval.

## Domain Overlays

Domain overlays may add or specialize this policy. They must not silently weaken
hard general rules. Any override must record the authority, reason, approver,
and target scope.
