# Semantic Regression Suite

This directory contains the persistent semantic-regression corpus for the current
TikZ semantic verifier.

Scope:

- supported good cases for the current render-generated `flowchart`, `dag`, and `tree` families
- mutation cases that preserve the original semantic target and intentionally change rendered output
- one fail-closed unsupported-family boundary case

The suite definition is the source of truth for regression expectations. Compiled
artifacts are generated at run time by `semantic_regression_runner.py` and are not
checked into the repository.
