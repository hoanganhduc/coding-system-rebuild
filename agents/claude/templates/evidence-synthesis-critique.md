# Evidence Synthesis Critique

Use this template to review a draft synthesis before delivery.

## Inputs

- source ledger
- task packet refs
- result packet refs
- draft synthesis
- known limitations

## Checks

| Check | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Scope coverage | Claimed scope matches inspected evidence |
| Evidence support | Important claims cite source or result refs |
| Delegation validity | Result packets are validated before use |
| Provider policy | Research roles used latest model and highest thinking |
| Nested delegation | Child worker outputs obey same-model and depth limits |
| Limitations | Remaining gaps are explicit |

## Verdict

Return `PASS`, `FLAG`, or `BLOCK`.

## Repairs

List the smallest changes required before the parent can deliver the report.
If material evidence is missing, require `incomplete analysis`.
