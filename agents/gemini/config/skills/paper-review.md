# Paper Review

Use this skill for the normal single-agent review flow.

## Trigger rule

Use this skill when the user asks for a review-only pass such as:

- review this paper
- critique this paper
- hard review
- find issues in this paper
- review and add to Zotero

Do **not** use this skill when the user explicitly asks for both annotation and review.
In that case, use `annotated-review` instead.

If the user explicitly asks for multiple agents, a panel, or a multi-agent review,
use `agent-group-discuss` instead of this skill.

If the user asks to write a Mathematical Reviews/MathSciNet or zbMATH public
bibliographic review, route to `draft-writing` with
`mathscinet-zbmath-review-style.md` instead of this referee-style workflow.

If the request names either service, load
`mathscinet-zbmath-review-style.md` before drafting or finalizing the review.
The request does not by itself imply that the item was supplied by either
service. Do not require a provenance declaration or stop before content access
unless the user states, or the artifact itself indicates, that it is
service-supplied.

If `mathscinet-zbmath-review-style.md` is unavailable in the current install,
disclose the missing style guidance and do not claim service-format compliance.
Do not reconstruct it from memory.

## Document lookup order for review tasks

If the user did not already provide a source path, attached file, PDF, or source tree:

1. check `zotero`
2. if not found there, check `calibre`
3. only if neither library has the document, use an online path such as `getscipapers-requester`

For review tasks, do not go online before checking both local libraries.

## Document parsing preference

When you have the document as a local PDF, office file, HTML export, or image-backed scan, prefer `docling` for structure-aware parsing before relying on ad hoc plain-text extraction.

Use Docling especially when the review depends on:

- section hierarchy
- table extraction
- figure or picture detection
- reading order in complex layouts
- OCR on scanned pages

## Writing Style Gate

Before writing review prose, load `writing-style-settings.md` and record the
active style profile for the review artifact. If the paper is a mathematical,
TCS, graph-theoretic, Lean, or LaTeX manuscript, also load
`math-manuscript-style.md`. Final review artifacts should record
`style_profile_ref`, `policy_hash`, `active_overlays`,
`active_requirement_ids`, and `style_applied`; do not treat a bare
`style_applied: true` assertion as
evidence that the style policy was loaded.

## Zotero rule

Zotero note storage is off by default for review-only requests.

- "Review this paper" -> review only, no Zotero write
- "Review and add to Zotero" -> do the review first, and only add/store in Zotero if the review workflow explicitly supports it and the user asked for it

Do not touch Zotero beyond lookup/retrieval unless the user explicitly asks.

For load-bearing lemmas, you may list **formal candidates** and recommend the
informal-to-lean / `opengauss` lane. Do not launch OpenGauss during a
review-only request unless the user also asked to formalize or prove.

## Review expectations

- Keep the review single-agent by default.
- Focus on correctness, argument quality, clarity, missing assumptions, and important edge cases.
- When useful, use the imported `references/common_issues.md` and `references/reporting_standards.md` as internal checklists.
- Summarize the main issues clearly, with evidence from the provided or retrieved document.
- If the document cannot be found in Zotero or Calibre, report that before attempting online retrieval.
- If you need a narrow internal checklist for proof auditing or single-reviewer critique, adapt `source-research/references/specialist-subagents.md` without turning the task into a multi-agent run unless the user asked for one.
- For review-only requests, stop after the review. Do not annotate, store notes,
  patch manuscripts, retrieve extra nonessential artifacts, or begin fixes
  unless the user explicitly asks for those actions.

### Book-specific branch

When reviewing a book, also assess the intended audience and prerequisites;
organization and navigation; proof and exposition quality; examples and
exercises; figures; index, glossary, and notation aids; and the bibliography's
attribution and currency. Select only the factors material to the requested
review. If a venue or commissioning context is supplied, report venue fit
separately from correctness and exposition.

## Revision Recommendations

When recommending a revision, follow the Writing Recommendation Contract in
`writing-review.md`. Tie any literal replacement text to the affected frozen
claim IDs, evidence refs, and active requirement IDs; flag any change to a
claim, caveat, citation, or support mapping. Recommendations remain advisory
and must not be applied during a review-only request.

## Local And Global Errors

Adapted from Terence Tao, "On local and global errors in mathematical papers and
how to detect them". The two kinds need different reading, and a review that
runs only one of them misses the other entirely.

A **local error** is a low-level objection to a specific step: an implication
that does not hold, a circularity where A is justified by B and B by A, or a
term used with two different meanings in different places. Finding them means
reading a substantial part of the paper line by line and checking that each
definition is used consistently.

A **global error** is a high-level objection showing the argument would prove
something known or strongly suspected to be false. The strongest form is a
counterexample to the main claim. Finding them means skimming for the
large-scale structure rather than reading closely, then asking:

- is there a counterexample to the stated result
- does a hypothesis that ought to be crucial go mysteriously unused
- would the same argument, applied to a parallel claim, prove something false

**Global errors are the more serious.** A local error can often be worked
around; a counterexample invalidates the proof as it stands and every
reasonable perturbation of it. Run the global pass first: it is quicker, and a
global error makes the line-by-line pass unnecessary.

The two passes also differ in what they deliver. A global objection says the
result is wrong but not where; a local objection names the exact step. Report
both kinds distinctly, and never present a local fix for what is actually a
global failure.

Concentrate the line-by-line pass where the statements suddenly get stronger —
where something proved for one value is amplified to hold for many, or where an
argument is transferred between dimensions or scales. That is where the idea
powering the proof sits, and where a flaw is most likely to be.

## Recommended output format

### Summary

- paper title, authors, venue/year when available
- overall assessment
- active writing-style profile and overlays, if the review is stored as an
  artifact

### Issues

For each issue:

- **Severity**: critical / major / minor / suggestion
- **Scope**: global (the claim or the whole approach fails) / local (this step fails)
- **Type**: logic / math / consistency / notation / presentation / missing / unsupported
- **Location**: page, section, line, or paragraph reference
- **Quote**: short supporting quote when helpful
- **Description**: what fails and why

### Strengths

- key contributions
- what works well

### Recommended actions

- prioritized fixes, highest severity first

## Routing boundary

- review-only -> this skill
- annotate + review -> `annotated-review`
- multi-agent review -> `agent-group-discuss`

## Recommended templates

When this skill is involved, consider these workflow templates (install via
the `workflow-templates` artifact profile, or `--with-deps` to pull backing skills):

- `cross-agent-adversarial-review` -- Producer-never-confirmer adversarial review of a paper, proof, or code artifact across agent families with a fresh-agent confirmation gate.
- `writing-review` -- Independent review-to-revision handoff using existing claim ledgers, V1 packets, and parent-owned acceptance.
