## Antigravity CLI Runtime Notes

This skill is installed as an Antigravity CLI global Markdown skill under
`~/.gemini/config/skills/`. Plugin payloads managed by this installer live under
`~/.gemini/config/plugins/ai-agents-skills/`.


<!-- Managed by ai-agents-skills. Generated target: antigravity. -->

Use this skill when the user asks about Classroom50, foundation50 classroom tooling, GitHub Classroom alternatives for VNU courses, C50 roster sync, listing C50 classrooms/assignments, or exporting a Classroom50-compatible roster CSV.

## Core rules

- Do not fork or reimplement Classroom50 / `gh teacher` in this skill.
- On POSIX, require the dedicated course environment and use it for every
  adapter command. OpenClaw's locked sandbox owns an image-local environment;
  normal host agents use the restored home environment:

```bash
if [ "${HOME:-}" = /workspace ] && [ "${OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE:-}" = /workspace ]; then
  course_python=/opt/coding-system/python-closure/course-management/bin/python
else
  course_python="$HOME/.course_venv/bin/python"
fi
if [ ! -x "$course_python" ]; then
  printf '%s\n' 'TECHNICAL_FAIL: dedicated course interpreter is missing' >&2
  exit 1
fi
"$course_python" -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent <command> [options]
```

- On native Windows, resolve the same dedicated environment in PowerShell:

```powershell
$coursePython = "$env:USERPROFILE\.course_venv\Scripts\python.exe"
if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $coursePython -PathType Leaf)) {
  throw "TECHNICAL_FAIL: dedicated course interpreter is missing"
}
& $coursePython -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent <command> [options]
```

- **Always** use the agent entrypoint for ordinary Classroom50 operations. The
  sole agent-side remote-write exception is an assignment script satisfying
  every condition in **Explicitly confirmed assignment-write exception** below.
- Do not invoke arbitrary raw `gh teacher`, a raw `gh-teacher` executable, or
  any `gh student` command. The exact direct readiness probe
  `gh teacher --help` remains allowed. A qualifying assignment-write script may
  internally invoke its checksum-pinned `gh-teacher` executable only for the
  reviewed `assignment add` operations; this does not authorize ad-hoc CLI
  construction or any other teacher/student command.
- Do **not** push a roster or otherwise change remote membership, invite,
  unenroll, remove an assignment, create/remove/teardown a classroom, download
  submissions, collect submissions or scores, run student acceptance/submission
  commands, or pass confirmation-skip flags. Read-only roster/list operations,
  local roster sync, and local CSV export remain on the restricted agent
  entrypoint.
- Require org allowlist in the environment for agent ops:

```bash
export CLASSROOM50_ORG_ALLOWLIST=my-org
# COURSE_C50_AGENT_MODE is set by c50_agent automatically
```

- If `course_hoanganhduc` is not importable, report the missing package in the
  selected course interpreter instead of claiming Classroom50 access. Do not
  silently install or switch environments.
- If readiness fails because the teacher extension is missing, report the
  missing `classroom50-teacher-extension`. For a manual, unpinned installation,
  the upstream command is `gh extension install foundation50/gh-teacher`;
  restoration systems own release pins and checksums.
- Never print tokens, PATs, or service secrets.

## Explicitly confirmed assignment-write exception

This is the only agent-side Classroom50 remote-mutation path. It permits
assignment registration or an explicitly intended replacement, both implemented
upstream as `assignment add`; it does not expose a general teacher CLI.

An agent may execute one reviewed local script once only after the user directly
authorizes the agent to run that exact script and exact assignment scope. A
direct imperative such as “run it” is sufficient when the immediately identified
script and scope are unambiguous. Approval to plan, prepare, inspect, or test the
script is not execution authorization. One authorization may cover the complete
reviewed assignment set; do not require confirmation for each assignment.

Before execution, verify all of the following and fail closed if any check fails:

1. Bind authorization to the script’s absolute path, SHA-256, exact organization,
   exact classroom, exact assignment slugs, and create-versus-replace intent.
   Any script or scope change voids the authorization.
2. The script is a regular non-symlink file owned by the expected local account,
   has one hard link, and is not group- or world-writable.
3. Launch it with an allowlisted clean environment through an absolute shell
   path, with `BASH_ENV=/dev/null`; clearing `BASH_ENV` or imported functions
   from inside the script is not sufficient. Preserve only variables required
   for the reviewed authentication and locale.
4. The script uses an absolute `gh-teacher` executable whose version and
   publisher checksum were reviewed and whose checksum is reverified immediately
   before execution. It must not download code, source another file, use `eval`,
   self-modify, accept free-form arguments, or obtain its target or mutation
   command from ambient environment variables.
5. The authenticated GitHub identity and organization allowlist match the
   reviewed values. The script verifies the classroom’s immutable identity and
   configuration path, not merely its display name.
6. The only permitted remote write is `assignment add` for the reviewed slugs in
   the reviewed classroom. A new assignment must be absent before creation. An
   existing assignment may be replaced only when replacement was explicitly
   authorized and the script verifies its complete expected pre-state.
7. Maintain an exclusive-writer window for the target classroom configuration,
   the involved private-template permissions, and the target teams throughout
   the run. The upstream writer cannot atomically exclude a concurrent
   same-slug update or a concurrent permission change.
8. Pin and verify every template revision and teacher-side tests payload used by
   the assignment. Reject unexpected or duplicate assignment slugs.
9. For every write, record the configuration head before and after and verify a
   single-parent change affecting only the reviewed classroom’s
   `assignments.json`. Verify the final exact assignment inventory and settings.
   Production classrooms may be read for before/after drift checks but must not
   be write targets unless every condition of a dated, exact-scope production
   exception below is satisfied.
10. Stop on the first failed or indeterminate write. Do not automatically rerun
    the script. Reconcile through the restricted read-only entrypoint first; a
    further execution requires renewed direct authorization.

This exception never covers assignment removal, roster or membership mutation,
invitations, classroom creation or teardown, submission/score collection,
downloads, repository deletion, general permission changes, general
production-course writes, or any `gh student` operation. A dated production
exception below may authorize only the exact assignment additions and automatic
private-template grants it enumerates; it does not broaden any other operation.

### Dated VNU-HUS production registration exception — 2026-09-03

The user approved preparation of one exact, single-attempt production runner for
HK1 2026–2027. Remote execution still requires the user to see and directly
authorize the final script’s absolute path, SHA-256, and exact scope. All generic
assignment-write safeguards above continue to apply.

For this runner, ordinary Classroom50 reads must use a protected, hash-pinned
archive of the restricted `course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent` entrypoint. Run that
archive with isolated Python (`-I -S`) and route its closed read-only command map
through a protected wrapper to the same checksum-pinned `gh-teacher` v1.40.0
binary. Do not execute adapter or validation code from a mutable checkout.

The only production classrooms permitted by this exception are
`vnu-hus-mat1206e-winter-2026` and `vnu-hus-mat3508-winter-2026`. Each is
bound to exactly four team IDs (student, teacher, HTA and TA) recorded in the
owner's private scope file
`~/.config/course/classroom50/production-scope-2026-09-03.json` (mode 0600,
kept in the encrypted recovery set, never in a public repository). Read the
team IDs from that file; if it is missing or unreadable, or does not list
exactly those four IDs for a classroom, this exception does not apply.

The intent is create-only. Each target must begin without every listed slug, and
the runner may add exactly one instance of each slug to each classroom:

- `w00-individual-onboarding`;
- `w00-group-collaboration`;
- `ch01-introduction`;
- `ch02-propositional-logic`;
- `ch03-first-order-logic`;
- `ch04-limitations-of-logic`;
- `ch05-prolog`;
- `ch06-search`.

The only permitted side-effect outside the two target `assignments.json` files
is the upstream CLI’s automatic `pull` grant for each of the six exact private
repositories `VNU-HUS/introai-ch01-template` through
`VNU-HUS/introai-ch06-template`. For each repository, the permitted new grantees
are only the student, HTA, and TA teams identified above for both classrooms:
exactly thirty-six new team grants in total. The Week 0 templates are public and
must cause no grant. Teacher teams, Pilot teams, direct collaborators, all other
teams, and all other repositories must remain unchanged.

This exception excludes replacement, removal, retry, rollback, roster changes,
student acceptance or testing, Codespaces, submission or score operations,
course settings, template content changes, cleanup, Pilot writes, Chapter 7,
MiniProject, and every classroom or slug not listed above. The runner must stop
on its first failed or indeterminate operation and report the exact partial
state, including actual assignment inventories and normalized permission
snapshots for all six private templates. Its one-attempt authority is consumed
after the authorized absolute-path and clean-launch checks succeed and the
exclusive attempt marker is created, before any further local validation or
remote call. Success or an early stop both consume that authority; any
continuation requires a newly reviewed script and renewed direct authorization.

## Safe doctor and readiness

The doctor path is non-mutating. In Bash, first resolve `course_python` as
shown above, then run this fail-closed function:

```bash
classroom50_doctor() {
  local failed=0
  gh teacher --help >/dev/null || {
    printf '%s\n' 'TECHNICAL_FAIL: gh teacher is unavailable' >&2
    failed=1
  }
  "$course_python" -c 'import course_hoanganhduc' || {
    printf '%s\n' 'TECHNICAL_FAIL: course package is unavailable' >&2
    failed=1
  }
  "$course_python" -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent --help >/dev/null || {
    printf '%s\n' 'TECHNICAL_FAIL: Classroom50 adapter is unavailable' >&2
    failed=1
  }
  gh auth status || {
    printf '%s\n' 'REAUTH_REQUIRED: GitHub authentication is unavailable' >&2
    failed=1
  }
  if [ -n "${CLASSROOM50_ORG_ALLOWLIST:-}" ]; then
    printf '%s\n' 'CLASSROOM50_ORG_ALLOWLIST=CONFIGURED'
  else
    printf '%s\n' 'CLASSROOM50_ORG_ALLOWLIST=NOT_CONFIGURED' >&2
    failed=1
  fi
  return "$failed"
}
classroom50_doctor
```

In native Windows PowerShell, use the equivalent fail-closed checks:

```powershell
$doctorFailed = $false
gh teacher --help *> $null
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
  [Console]::Error.WriteLine("TECHNICAL_FAIL: gh teacher is unavailable")
  $doctorFailed = $true
}
& $coursePython -c "import course_hoanganhduc"
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
  [Console]::Error.WriteLine("TECHNICAL_FAIL: course package is unavailable")
  $doctorFailed = $true
}
& $coursePython -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent --help *> $null
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
  [Console]::Error.WriteLine("TECHNICAL_FAIL: Classroom50 adapter is unavailable")
  $doctorFailed = $true
}
gh auth status
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
  [Console]::Error.WriteLine("REAUTH_REQUIRED: GitHub authentication is unavailable")
  $doctorFailed = $true
}
if ([string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($env:CLASSROOM50_ORG_ALLOWLIST)) {
  [Console]::Error.WriteLine("CLASSROOM50_ORG_ALLOWLIST=NOT_CONFIGURED")
  $doctorFailed = $true
} else {
  Write-Output "CLASSROOM50_ORG_ALLOWLIST=CONFIGURED"
}
if ($doctorFailed) { throw "Classroom50 doctor failed" }
```

Never add `--show-token` to `gh auth status`, and never echo the allowlist
value. Classify failures without guessing:

- missing extension, interpreter, or import: `TECHNICAL_FAIL`
- failed or expired GitHub authentication: `REAUTH_REQUIRED`
- absent allowlist: `NOT_CONFIGURED`

After the local doctor passes, the adapter preflight is the only live readiness
probe. It may make read-only GitHub requests but does not mutate classroom data:

```bash
"$course_python" -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent preflight
```

```powershell
& $coursePython -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent preflight
```

Report `READY` only when the local checks, authentication, allowlist, and live
adapter preflight all pass.

## Common agent commands

```bash
"$course_python" -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent preflight
"$course_python" -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent list-classrooms --org ORG
"$course_python" -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent list-roster --org ORG --classroom SHORT
"$course_python" -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent list-assignments --org ORG --classroom SHORT
"$course_python" -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent sync --org ORG --classroom SHORT --db students.db --report report.json
"$course_python" -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent export --db students.db --out classroom50_roster.csv
```

```powershell
& $coursePython -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent preflight
& $coursePython -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent list-classrooms --org ORG
& $coursePython -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent list-roster --org ORG --classroom SHORT
& $coursePython -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent list-assignments --org ORG --classroom SHORT
& $coursePython -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent sync --org ORG --classroom SHORT --db students.db --report report.json
& $coursePython -m course_hoanganhduc.c50_agent export --db students.db --out classroom50_roster.csv
```

`download` via the agent entrypoint is refused by design.

## Optional human CLI (outside agent entry)

For interactive human operators only, the full `course` CLI may expose:

- `--download-classroom50` with `--classroom50-assignment` and `--classroom50-download-dest`
- Other Classroom50 list/sync/export flags mirroring the agent surface

Prefer the agent entrypoint for agent sessions.

## Natural-language routing

- "whoami / is Classroom50 auth ok?" → `preflight`
- "list C50 classrooms in ORG" → `list-classrooms --org ORG`
- "list roster for classroom X" → `list-roster --org … --classroom X`
- "sync Classroom50 roster into my DB" → `sync …`
- "export C50 CSV" → `export …`
- "download submissions" → explain human-only; do not run agent download

## Target notes

- This skill is target-adaptable; do not hardcode user-specific checkout paths.
- In OpenClaw's `/workspace` sandbox, the restoring system must provide the
  image-local course environment, the teacher extension below
  `/workspace/.local/share/gh/extensions/`, and a private GitHub CLI config
  projection below `/workspace/.config/gh/`.
- Secrets and GitHub auth come from the existing `gh` login / environment; this skill does not provide secret setup instructions.
