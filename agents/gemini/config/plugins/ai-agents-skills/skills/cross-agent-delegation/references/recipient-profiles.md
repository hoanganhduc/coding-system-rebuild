# Recipient Profiles

Recipient profiles are reference-only adapter specifications. They describe
the shape of a packet recipient, not a live CLI, API, SDK, MCP server, tool
loop, or configured provider.

All V1 profiles have `execution_status: reference_only`.

Runtime CLI capability profiles, probes, command flags, raw logs, session IDs,
and provider-specific execution observations are outside this contract. A
parent orchestrator such as `agent-group-discuss` may maintain those artifacts
out of band and reference only inert artifacts from task or result packets.

## Profiles

### codex-like-coding-reviewer

- intended recipient family: Codex-like coding or planning reviewer
- supported packet versions: `cross-agent-delegation.task.v1`,
  `cross-agent-delegation.result.v1`
- accepted inputs: inert code refs, plan refs, issue refs, summary refs
- expected outputs: result packet with findings, evidence, limitations, warnings,
  and errors
- unsupported task classes: live execution, shell commands, repo mutation,
  credential use, external posting
- symbolic credential requirements: none in V1
- confirmation requirements: parent-owned, outside packet content

### claude-like-research-reviewer

- intended recipient family: Claude-like research or long-context reviewer
- supported packet versions: `cross-agent-delegation.task.v1`,
  `cross-agent-delegation.result.v1`
- accepted inputs: inert paper, excerpt, proof, claim, source, and synthesis refs
- expected outputs: evidence-grounded result packet
- unsupported task classes: live retrieval, hidden memory access, tool execution,
  credential use, external posting
- symbolic credential requirements: none in V1
- confirmation requirements: parent-owned, outside packet content

### deepseek-like-model-reviewer

- intended recipient family: DeepSeek-like model-only reviewer
- supported packet versions: `cross-agent-delegation.task.v1`,
  `cross-agent-delegation.result.v1`
- accepted inputs: minimized prompt-safe refs and summaries
- expected outputs: result packet with explicit limitations
- unsupported task classes: local tools, workspace reads, shell commands,
  provider probing, credential use, external posting
- symbolic credential requirements: none in V1
- endpoint requirement: a live CodeWhale/DeepSeek CLI reads its model endpoint
  from `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` in headless `exec` (the config-file `base_url` is
  honored only by the interactive TUI); the delegation dispatcher defaults it to
  `https://api.deepseek.com` when unset, and the external-agent precheck reports
  it under `endpoint`
- confirmation requirements: parent-owned, outside packet content

This packet profile is reference-only. A parent workflow such as
`agent-group-discuss` may route to a live CodeWhale or DeepSeek-like CLI only
after fresh capability probes satisfy the run policy.

### copilot-like-code-reviewer

- intended recipient family: Copilot-like code or repository workflow reviewer
- supported packet versions: `cross-agent-delegation.task.v1`,
  `cross-agent-delegation.result.v1`
- accepted inputs: inert repository, file, diff, issue, and source-summary refs
- expected outputs: evidence-grounded result packet with code or workflow
  findings, limitations, warnings, and blocked checks
- unsupported task classes: direct repo mutation, command execution, credential
  use, external posting, provider probing, or approval handling
- symbolic credential requirements: none in V1
- confirmation requirements: parent-owned, outside packet content

This packet profile does not claim Copilot runtime availability. A parent
workflow must verify CLI, auth/config status, model selection, output contract,
and file-read fidelity before using a live Copilot-like participant.

### antigravity-like-code-reviewer

- intended recipient family: Antigravity CLI code, repository, or research
  workflow reviewer
- supported packet versions: `cross-agent-delegation.task.v1`,
  `cross-agent-delegation.result.v1`
- accepted inputs: inert repository, file, diff, issue, excerpt, claim, and
  source-summary refs
- expected outputs: evidence-grounded result packet with findings, limitations,
  warnings, and blocked checks
- unsupported task classes: direct repo mutation, command execution, credential
  use, external posting, provider probing, approval handling, or direct language
  server attachment
- symbolic credential requirements: none in V1
- endpoint requirement: none; live dispatch is CLI-based through the Antigravity
  CLI binary `agy` and does not require `ANTIGRAVITY_LS_ADDRESS`
- confirmation requirements: parent-owned, outside packet content

This packet profile does not claim Antigravity runtime availability. A parent
workflow must verify `agy` CLI availability, auth/config status, model
selection, output contract, and file-read fidelity before using a live
Antigravity-like participant.

**Parent-owned live dispatch (not packet fields):**

Canonical headless shape (ARL / managed `delegate-agent`):

```bash
agy -p "<prompt>" --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Critical argv rule: `-p` / `--print` **consumes the next argv token as the
prompt**. Never place another flag between `-p` and the prompt text.

| Correct | Wrong (prompt becomes the flag name) |
|---------|----------------------------------------|
| `agy -p "$PROMPT" --dangerously-skip-permissions` | `agy --print --dangerously-skip-permissions "$PROMPT"` |
| `agy -p "$PROMPT" --dangerously-skip-permissions --print-timeout=40m0s` | `agy --print --effort high "$PROMPT"` |

`agy` does **not** read the user prompt from stdin. Headless file tools need
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` **after** the prompt (or explicit
`permissions.allow` in settings). Full failure taxonomy and parent checklist:
`agent-group-discuss/references/external-cli-agents.md` § Antigravity.

### grok-like-code-reviewer

- intended recipient family: Grok CLI code, repository, or research workflow
  reviewer
- supported packet versions: `cross-agent-delegation.task.v1`,
  `cross-agent-delegation.result.v1`
- accepted inputs: inert repository, file, diff, issue, excerpt, claim, and
  source-summary refs
- expected outputs: evidence-grounded result packet with findings, limitations,
  warnings, and blocked checks
- unsupported task classes: direct repo mutation, command execution, credential
  use, external posting, provider probing, or approval handling
- symbolic credential requirements: none in V1
- endpoint requirement: none; live dispatch is CLI-based through
  `grok --prompt-file /dev/stdin`; automatic selection confirms the exact
  resolved model in anchored bare `grok models` available-model rows before it
  permits a route-neutral `grok-remote` fallback, and uses an interactive OIDC
  session rather than an API-key environment variable
- confirmation requirements: parent-owned, outside packet content

This packet profile does not claim Grok runtime availability. A parent workflow
must verify Grok CLI availability, auth/config status, concrete model and
release identity, output contract, and file-read fidelity before using a live
Grok-like participant. Routing remains parent-owned capability state. With a
resolved model, exact bare-model membership selects and model-pins bare Grok;
only non-confirmation authorizes proxy fallback. Without a resolved model,
automatic selection stays bare and records that latest-model verification was
not performed. Explicit `AAS_GROK_DISPATCH_COMMAND` and `AAS_GROK` choices are
preserved and never silently replaced. For a selected proxy, verify profile
readiness with `grok-remote doctor --json`: only `ready` or `degraded` with the
exact `grok-remote.profile-status.v1` field set and matching `model_id` permits
dispatch. Invalid, `blocked`, or `unconfigured` results fail closed; private
topology does not enter capability metadata.

### kimi-like-code-reviewer

- intended recipient family: Kimi Code CLI code, repository, or research workflow
  reviewer
- supported packet versions: `cross-agent-delegation.task.v1`,
  `cross-agent-delegation.result.v1`
- accepted inputs: inert repository, file, diff, issue, excerpt, claim, and
  source-summary refs
- expected outputs: evidence-grounded result packet with findings, limitations,
  warnings, and blocked checks
- unsupported task classes: direct repo mutation, command execution, credential
  use, external posting, provider probing, or approval handling
- symbolic credential requirements: none in V1
- endpoint requirement: none; live dispatch is CLI-based with
  **runtime argv prompt** transport (`kimi -p <prompt>` appended after the prompt
  is known). Research runs require `AAS_KIMI_DISPATCH_COMMAND` and a resolved
  model. Credentials live in `~/.kimi-code/config.toml` / `credentials/` and must
  never enter packets
- confirmation requirements: parent-owned, outside packet content

This packet profile does not claim Kimi runtime availability. A parent workflow
must verify Kimi CLI availability, auth/config status (path existence only),
output contract, and file-read fidelity before using a live Kimi-like
participant.

Live one-shot / panel notes (parent-owned; not packet fields):

- Dispatch is `kimi -p <prompt>` (optional `-m <model>`). Do **not** combine
  `--prompt` with `--yolo` / `-y` / `--auto` (CLI error:
  `Cannot combine --prompt with --yolo`).
- Keep prompts under the managed argv budget (~24k chars in
  `delegate-agent`). For AGD panels, prefer a compressed brief plus inert
  path refs over dumping full evidence trees into argv.
- Expect the answer on **stdout**. Empty/short stdout with long stderr is a
  failed or partial participant, not a result packet body.
- See `agent-group-discuss/references/external-cli-agents.md` § Kimi one-shot /
  AGD panel rules.

### model-only-api-reviewer

- intended recipient family: generic model-only reviewer
- supported packet versions: `cross-agent-delegation.task.v1`,
  `cross-agent-delegation.result.v1`
- accepted inputs: minimized summaries and inert refs
- expected outputs: result packet with limitations and evidence references
- unsupported task classes: tool use, file access, command execution, runtime
  dispatch, credential use, external posting
- symbolic credential requirements: none in V1
- confirmation requirements: parent-owned, outside packet content

### openclaw-host-reference

- intended recipient family: OpenClaw interoperability reference
- supported packet versions: `cross-agent-delegation.task.v1`,
  `cross-agent-delegation.result.v1`
- accepted inputs: reference-only notes, not native install artifacts
- expected outputs: descriptive result packet only
- unsupported task classes: OpenClaw native install target support, real
  `.openclaw` writes, runtime helpers, shell hooks, provider config, queues,
  ledgers, or execution state
- symbolic credential requirements: none in V1
- confirmation requirements: parent-owned, outside packet content

OpenClaw is not a V1 `supported_agents` target. If explicitly requested by an
installer plan, V1 must fail closed or skip according to installer policy.
