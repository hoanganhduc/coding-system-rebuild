## Antigravity CLI Runtime Notes

This skill is installed as an Antigravity CLI global Markdown skill under
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/`. Plugin payloads managed by this

# Graph Verifier


## Windows Runtime Commands

On native Windows, use the managed Windows runner and the native runtime command target. Set `$runtime` to the installed runtime root. Multi-agent installs usually use `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ai-agents-skills\runtime`. Then run:

```powershell
$runtime = if ($env:AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT) { $env:AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT } else { "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\ai-agents-skills\runtime" }
& "$runtime\run_skill.bat" "skills/graph-verifier/run_graph_verifier.bat" <args>
```

POSIX examples below use `run_skill.sh` and `.sh` command targets; use the Windows command target above on native Windows.

This uses the managed ai-agents-skills runtime copy of the graph verifier workflow.

## When to use

- sanity-check a small graph claim
- inspect a finite construction
- validate an edge list, adjacency map, or graph encoding
- check simple properties such as connectivity or bipartiteness

For heavier graph-theoretic or algebraic computations, route to `sagemath` instead.

## Base path

- `$AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT/workspace/skills/graph-verifier/`

Use the managed runtime runner rather than invoking `run_graph_verifier.sh` directly.
Set `AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT` to the installed runtime root before using the shared
runner directly.

Shared runner:

- `runtime_root="${AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT:?Set AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT to the installed runtime root}"; bash "$runtime_root/run_skill.sh"`

## Workflow

1. Save JSON input to `/tmp/graph_input.json`.
2. Run the verifier.
3. Read the JSON result from stdout.

Supported shapes include `graph_data`, `edges`, `adjacency`, and optional `expected` values.

## Core command

```bash
runtime_root="${AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT:?Set AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT to the installed runtime root}"
bash "$runtime_root/run_skill.sh" skills/graph-verifier/run_graph_verifier.sh --input /tmp/graph_input.json
```

## Recommended templates

When this skill is involved, consider this workflow template (install via
the `workflow-templates` artifact profile, or `--with-deps` to pull backing skills):

- `tikz-figure-verification-runbook` -- Bounded draw-compile-verify-redraw loop for a TikZ figure that guarantees it is free of overlap, wrong meaning, and bad layout, with Sage-assisted graph realization and fresh-agent visual confirmation before the strict approval gate.
