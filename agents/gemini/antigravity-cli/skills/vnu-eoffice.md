## Antigravity CLI Runtime Notes

This skill is installed as an Antigravity CLI global Markdown skill under
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/`. Plugin payloads managed by this
installer live under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/plugins/ai-agents-skills/`.


<!-- Managed by ai-agents-skills. Generated target: antigravity. -->

Use this skill when the user asks about VNU eOffice, VNU e-office, eoffice.vnu.edu.vn, incoming documents, outgoing documents, document summaries, document searches, or Telegram delivery of eOffice attachments.

Core rules:
- Do not fork or paste target-specific helper code into this canonical skill.
- Do not print credentials, tokens, chat ids, or secret setup instructions.
- Use both modules by default: `den` for incoming and `di` for outgoing.
- Ignore eOffice read/unread state. The user may also read posts manually in a browser, so selection and monitoring must rely on fetched document ids and keyword/category filters.
- Fetch multiple pages by default. Use `--pages N` when the user asks for a deeper or shallower scan.
- Only download and send document files when the user explicitly asks for files or asks to download/send results.
- After sending files, delete local copies unless the user explicitly asks to keep them.
- Number latest/search results in the response and keep a mapping from item number to `module:intid` in the active chat/task context.
- If a target adapter provides persisted item numbers, use that adapter's `items` command before resolving an ambiguous follow-up request.

Execution surface:
- Prefer the installed package CLI: `python -m vnu_eoffice <command>` or `vnu-eoffice <command>`.
- If the package is not importable, use the target's normal project checkout mechanism to make `vnu_eoffice` importable. Do not hardcode a user-specific checkout path into the skill.
- Target adapters may wrap the package CLI with extra commands such as `latest`, `items`, and item-number download. Keep those adapters outside this canonical skill body.
- Secrets and Telegram config must come from the existing runtime environment or local secret store. This skill intentionally does not provide secret setup instructions.

Common commands:
- `python -m vnu_eoffice test-login`
- `python -m vnu_eoffice monitor --no-notify --limit 60 --pages 2 --min-level MEDIUM`
- `python -m vnu_eoffice list --limit 10 --pages 2 --modules den,di`
- `python -m vnu_eoffice search "<keywords>" --limit 10 --pages 2 --modules den,di`
- `python -m vnu_eoffice search "<keywords>" --limit 5 --pages 2 --has-attach`
- `python -m vnu_eoffice download --id den:12345`
- `python -m vnu_eoffice send --id di:98765 --delete-after`

Natural-language routing:
- "start updates now" or "check updates now": run `monitor --no-notify`, then reply with a titled summary.
- "send latest 10 summaries" or "login and send top 10": run `list --limit 10`; reply with both incoming and outgoing categories, number the results, and retain the `module:intid` mapping for follow-up.
- "search <keywords>": run `search "<keywords>"`; reply with numbered results and ask which item numbers to download.
- "search <keywords> and download results": run `search "<keywords>"`, number the results, and download only the selected item ids unless the user explicitly asks for all results.
- "download all documents of item 5 to me": map item 5 from the latest numbered response to its `module:intid`, then run `send --id <module:intid> --delete-after`.
- "download items 2 and 4": map both item numbers to their `module:intid` values, then run `send --id <module:intid> --id <module:intid> --delete-after`.
- "download all results": map every currently numbered result to `--id` arguments and run `send ... --delete-after`.

Target notes:
- This canonical skill is target-adaptable across supported install targets; target-specific paths should be resolved by the installing agent adapter or local environment.
- OpenClaw-specific rebuild material belongs to the OpenClaw adapter/rebuild plan, not to this ai-agents-skills canonical skill body.
