## Antigravity CLI Runtime Notes

This skill is installed as an Antigravity CLI global Markdown skill under
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/`. Plugin payloads managed by this
installer live under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/plugins/ai-agents-skills/`.

# GetSciPapers Requester


## Windows Runtime Commands

On native Windows, use the managed Windows runner and the native runtime command target. For Codex-only installs the runtime is usually `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\runtime`; for multi-agent installs it is usually `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ai-agents-skills\runtime`. Set `$runtime` to the installed runtime root, then run:

```powershell
$runtime = if ($env:AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT) { $env:AAS_RUNTIME_ROOT } elseif (Test-Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\runtime") { "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\runtime" } else { "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\ai-agents-skills\runtime" }
& "$runtime\run_skill.bat" "skills/getscipapers_requester/run_gsp_helper.bat" <args>
```

POSIX examples below use `run_skill.sh` and `.sh` command targets; use the Windows command target above on native Windows.

This is the external retrieval fallback. Do not use it before `zotero` for normal paper/library requests, and for review tasks that need a paper/book do not use it before both `zotero` and `calibre` have been checked.

## When to use

- The paper is not in Zotero
- and, for review tasks, it is also not in Calibre
- The user explicitly says "download"
- The task is DOI/ISBN/title resolution from external sources
- The user pasted many identifiers and wants batch retrieval

## Base path

- `~/.codex/runtime/workspace/skills/getscipapers_requester/`

Use the Codex runtime runner rather than invoking `run_gsp_helper.sh` directly. The runner
sets `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE`, `PYTHONPATH`, secrets, and workspace-local binaries.

Shared runner:

- `bash ~/.codex/runtime/run_skill.sh`

## Core commands

```bash
bash ~/.codex/runtime/run_skill.sh skills/getscipapers_requester/run_gsp_helper.sh run-getscipapers --timeout 180 -- getpapers --doi <DOI>
```

```bash
bash ~/.codex/runtime/run_skill.sh skills/getscipapers_requester/run_gsp_helper.sh resolve auto "<title>" --best
```

```bash
bash ~/.codex/runtime/run_skill.sh skills/getscipapers_requester/run_gsp_helper.sh make-manifest auto "<text-or-file>"
```

```bash
bash ~/.codex/runtime/run_skill.sh skills/getscipapers_requester/run_gsp_helper.sh doctor
```

## Workflow

1. If DOI/ISBN is available, use it directly.
2. Otherwise resolve from title or text.
3. For many papers, create a manifest first.
4. For large batches, prefer dry-run style validation first.
5. If retrieval fails, report the failure precisely instead of hand-waving.
