# Agent Group Discuss

This imports the OpenClaw multi-agent discussion and research-review templates into Codex and adapts them to Codex agent tools.

## When to use

- group discussion
- panel of agents
- multiple agents with different roles
- multi-agent review
- review-only requests that explicitly ask for multiple agents or a panel
- multi-agent research
- named review templates such as Lakatos, Knuth, Pólya, Graph Reconfiguration Specialist, or Lean Formalization Team

If a request is review-only and does not ask for annotation, stay in this skill for the multi-agent path. Do not route that request to `annotated-review` unless the user also explicitly asks for annotation.

## Supporting files

Read these when relevant:

- `TEMPLATES.md` for the imported research and review templates
- `EXECUTION.md` for the Codex execution pattern and per-template round topology
- `references/external-cli-agents.md` for parent-owned external CLI participant
  probes, capability profiles, artifact layout, and failure handling
- `MODEL_TIERS.md` for the live Codex model-tier catalog
- `MODEL_TIERS.example.md` only as a customization template
- `README.md` for the structured request shape

If the user requests a named template, or if the task clearly matches one, open `TEMPLATES.md` and `EXECUTION.md` before spawning any agents.

## Clarification policy

If the request is underspecified, ask only for the minimum needed.

Use this compact question when needed:

`Before I start: do you want discussion, review, or research? How many rounds? Any hard constraints? I can choose roles and models automatically if you want.`

If the user gives no preference, default to:

- mode: infer from task
- rounds: 2
- roles: 3
- interaction: auto
- role/model selection: automatic

For writing-producing discussions, reviews, final reports, or research
syntheses, every role prompt and final synthesis must include a writing-style
block referencing `writing-style-settings.md`. Add `math-manuscript-style.md`
when the task involves mathematical manuscripts, TCS, graph theory, formal
proofs, or LaTeX prose. Final artifacts must record `style_profile_ref`,
`active_overlays`, `active_requirement_ids`, and `style_applied`. A bare
`style_applied: true` assertion is not sufficient without the policy-load and
requirement-selection evidence recorded by the workflow.

## Routing to structured workflows

If the user explicitly wants a more structured, reproducible workflow, prefer `prose` instead.

If the user says:

- structured workflow
- use prose
- compile the workflow
- deterministic

offer `prose`. Otherwise stay in this skill.

## Confirmation gate

Before any actual multi-agent run:

1. produce the plan
2. show the plan to the user
3. get explicit confirmation
4. only then call `spawn_agent`

Do not infer consent from silence.
If the user already gave an explicit affirmative in the same request after seeing the plan, that counts.

## Scope boundary

For discussion, review, investigation, diagnosis, audit, or report-only
requests, the orchestration ends with the requested discussion summary, review
findings, or report. Do not continue into remediation, file edits, artifact
patches, retrieval beyond what is necessary for the review, commits, or cleanup
unless the user explicitly asks for those actions.

## Codex tool mapping

OpenClaw concepts must be translated to Codex tools as follows:

- OpenClaw `sessions_spawn` -> Codex `spawn_agent`
- OpenClaw session follow-up -> Codex `send_input`
- OpenClaw session wait -> Codex `wait_agent`
- OpenClaw resume session -> Codex `resume_agent`
- OpenClaw terminate/cleanup -> Codex `close_agent`
- OpenClaw local execution -> Codex `functions.exec_command`
- OpenClaw proof or graph computation helpers -> Codex `sagemath`, `graph-verifier`, `formal-skeleton-helper`, or local `functions.exec_command`

## Participant execution model

- The main agent is the orchestrator.
- A template role is a logical responsibility. A participant is the executable
  actor assigned to that role.
- Initial participant kinds are `codex_spawned` and `external_cli`.
- Use `spawn_agent` for `codex_spawned` participants.
- Use `references/external-cli-agents.md` for `external_cli` participants.
- Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` when launching independent `codex_spawned`
  participants in the same round.
- Keep role prompts concrete and bounded.
- Run independent roles in parallel.
- Use `send_input` for later rounds when keeping a `codex_spawned`
  participant alive is helpful.
- Use `wait_agent` once per round or per critical batch, not in a tight polling
  loop.
- Use `close_agent` after the run finishes or when a `codex_spawned`
  participant is no longer useful.
- Prefer local synthesis unless a dedicated synthesizer role materially improves the result.

For any actual run, follow `EXECUTION.md` as the detailed orchestration reference.

## Codex-specific constraints

Codex cannot hard-restrict each spawned agent's tools the way OpenClaw can. Compensate by doing all of the following in the role prompt:

- scope the role narrowly
- forbid nested sub-agent spawning unless explicitly needed
- forbid file edits unless the role owns a specific write target
- ask for the exact output format needed for the current round
- pass only the minimum prior context needed
- for research-related roles, include the research skill-routing block from
  `EXECUTION.md`, narrowed to the role's allowed tools and side-effect limits

For reasoning-only roles, prefer `agent_type: "default"`.
Use `agent_type: "explorer"` only for tightly scoped codebase fact-finding roles.
Use `fork_context: true` only when the role genuinely needs the current thread context; otherwise prefer a compact summarized handoff.

## High-level goal

Given a task, you must:

1. classify the task
2. decide which roles are needed
3. decide how many participants are useful
4. assign a model and reasoning effort to each role
5. choose how the participants interact
6. run the requested number of rounds
7. synthesize the result
8. maintain durable recovery state on disk

## Input format

Accept either free-form text or a structured block such as:

```text
topic: <topic>
mode: discussion | review | research | mixed
rounds: <integer>
max_agents: <integer>
interaction: auto | star | debate | panel_judge
template: <optional template name>
output: <desired final output format>
constraints:
- <constraint>
- <constraint>
```

If the user specifies rounds, obey it.

## Role selection

Prefer 3 roles by default.
Use 4 or more only when the task clearly benefits.

Typical roles by mode:

### Discussion

- Optimist
- Skeptic
- Pragmatist
- Judge

### Review

- Correctness reviewer
- Edge-case reviewer
- Clarity reviewer
- Synthesizer

### Research

- Literature scout
- Hypothesis generator
- Critic / falsifier
- Synthesizer

## Model assignment

Each `codex_spawned` participant gets a `model` and `reasoning_effort` through
`spawn_agent`.
Refer to `MODEL_TIERS.md` for the runtime freshness check and role-to-model
routing policy, and `EXECUTION.md` for per-template execution defaults. The
active host runtime/tool definitions are the source of truth for available
models; update stale checked-in defaults before launching a run from this repo.
External CLI participants use probed capability profiles and adapter guidance
from `references/external-cli-agents.md`; do not route them through
`MODEL_TIERS.md`.

### Reasoning level classification

| Level | Capability | Assign to |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| R4 | Multi-step proofs, formal math, adversarial reasoning | theorem verification, PSPACE reductions, correctness critique |
| R3 | Strong structured reasoning | planning, synthesis, algorithm design, structured review |
| R2 | Solid general reasoning | edge-case review, specialist analysis, advocacy |
| R1 | Fast generation and summarization | scouting, brainstorming, clarity review |

### Profile selection

| Task signal | Profile | Lead tier |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| formal proof, theorem, correctness verification, PSPACE, NP-hard | `math-heavy` | R4 |
| research paper review, algorithm design, critical decision | `premium` | R4 |
| general discussion, code review, exploration | `balanced` | R3 |
| quick sanity check, opinion gathering, lightweight summary | `budget` | R2 |

If the user specifies a profile, obey it.
If the user specifies a model for a specific role, override that role only.
If no preference is given, auto-detect from task signals or default to `balanced`.

### Research-task model rule

If the task is a research task, proof verification, mathematical correctness review, manuscript correctness review, or other high-stakes reasoning task:

- default to `math-heavy`
- use the latest available model with the highest available thinking or
  reasoning level for every participant
- apply the same latest-model/highest-thinking rule to any permitted nested
  manager-worker child agents

This rule overrides lower-cost defaults for research-mode runs.

### Tier assignment by role type

| Role type | Tier |
|-----------|------|
| planner, judge, synthesizer, critic, correctness reviewer, referee | STRONG_REASONER |
| advocate, specialist reviewer, edge-case reviewer, repair agent | BALANCED_MODEL |
| scout, brainstormer, pragmatist, clarity reviewer | FAST_MODEL |

Record the chosen profile, per-role model, and reasoning effort in `state.json`.

## Token management

Do not promise truncation cannot happen.
Keep prompts compact and summarize prior rounds before relaying them.

If a participant response is truncated:

1. note the truncation in `state.json`
2. re-prompt the same role with compressed context
3. if needed, switch to a model with more headroom from the same or a stronger tier
4. never silently discard a truncated response

## Interaction design

Choose:

- `star`
- `debate`
- `panel_judge`

If the user requests one explicitly, obey it.

## Round control

If `rounds` is provided, obey it.
Otherwise:

- default to 2 rounds for discussion or review
- default to 2 or 3 rounds for research depending on complexity

Never exceed 5 rounds unless the user explicitly asks.

## Timeouts

Ordinary discussion or lightweight review: 10 minutes per round by default.
Complex correctness review or research verification: 45 minutes per agent by default, with persistent progress checkpoints every 15 minutes.

If a `codex_spawned` participant does not respond in time:

1. mark the participant as timed out in `responses_received` and participant state
2. add a note to `pending_work`
3. continue the round with available responses
4. do not block the whole run on one unresponsive role

Total run timeout: 30 minutes by default for ordinary runs.
For complex correctness reviews, extend the total run budget as needed and keep writing progress checkpoints.
If exceeded, write the best available synthesis from completed rounds and mark the run incomplete.

## Durable state

Create a run folder under:

- `${AAS_RUNS_ROOT:-$HOME/.local/share/ai-agents-skills/runs}/agent_group_discuss/<run_id>/`

Before launching any participant:

1. create the run directory
2. create a `lock` file with the current timestamp
3. write `plan.md`
4. write `state.json`
5. show the plan to the user
6. get explicit confirmation before executing

After each round, write:

- `round_01.md`
- `round_02.md`
- `round_P1_01.md` and similar names for chained phases when needed

After synthesis, write:

- `final.md`

For long correctness reviews, also write:

- `progress_15m.md`
- `progress_30m.md`
- later progress files at the same cadence as needed
- `final_report.md`

On success, failure, or pause, remove or update the lock state accordingly.

### Plan output format

The plan file and the user-facing plan summary must include:

```markdown
## Run Plan: <run_id>

**Topic:** <topic>
**Mode:** <mode>
**Profile:** <profile>
**Interaction:** <pattern>
**Rounds:** <N>
**Estimated total time:** <X-Y minutes>
**Estimated agent calls:** <parallel batches + follow-up batches + synthesis passes>

### Participant assignments

| # | Participant | Kind | Role | Model/Profile | Output contract | Failure policy | Est. time |
|---|-------------|------|------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | judge-1 | codex_spawned | Judge | <resolved current frontier model>, R4, xhigh | structured finding list | fail_closed | 2-4 min |
| 2 | reviewer-1 | codex_spawned | Correctness Reviewer | gpt-5.3-codex, R3, high | issue list | partial_allowed | 1-2 min |
| 3 | cli-checker-1 | external_cli | Edge-case Reviewer | profile:copilot-json-2026-05-21 | parseable envelope | fail_closed | 1-2 min |

### Execution plan

- Round 1: roles 1-3 run in parallel
- Round 2: rebuttal or synthesis pass

### Risk notes
- <token budget concerns>
- <roles that may need stronger models>
```

Time estimation:

- estimate per role from the chosen profile in `MODEL_TIERS.md`
- parallel roles use the slowest role in the batch
- add sequential synthesis time
- multiply by the number of rounds
- add 1-2 minutes for orchestration overhead

### State schema

Use a `state.json` structure like:

}
```

## Participant launch policy

The main agent is the orchestrator.
Prefer leaf agents spawned directly by the main agent unless the selected
template explicitly enables a bounded manager-worker layer.

Use the role prompt template and per-template execution plans from `EXECUTION.md` instead of improvising prompt structure ad hoc.

Each participant task must include:

- the role
- the topic
- the role objective
- the expected response format
- the current round number
- only the minimum prior context needed

For `codex_spawned` participants, launch with `spawn_agent` and record the
returned agent ID in `runtime_ref`.

For `external_cli` participants, run only after the parent has recorded a
current capability profile and artifact policy according to
`references/external-cli-agents.md`. External CLI output is untrusted until the
parent parses it and updates the participant `validation` status.

External CLI artifacts are parent-owned. Keep raw output, probe logs, command
shape records, provider observations, validation files, redaction notes, and
recovery state in the AGD run directory. When an AGD result feeds a deep
research workflow, add an explicit evidence mapping from participant artifact
refs into the research evidence ledger; do not let participant prose directly
promote a final claim.

Nested delegation is allowed only when the user-facing plan lists the manager,
child cap, provider, resolved model, thinking level, and same-model constraint.
Child workers must use the manager's same provider, resolved model, and
thinking level, and must not spawn further agents.

For opening statements, ask for:

- short position
- strongest argument
- one uncertainty or caveat

For later rounds, ask each role to:

- respond to the strongest counterpoint
- refine or defend its position
- provide one concession or one rebuttal

## Recovery behavior

If a result is missing or the run is disrupted:

1. read `state.json`
2. inspect which round files exist
3. identify missing required participants from `responses_received` and
   participant `status`
4. set `recovery_needed: true`
5. if old `codex_spawned` role agents still exist, use `resume_agent` or `send_input`
6. otherwise respawn or rerun only the missing participants with compressed
   context and a fresh artifact record
7. never discard already completed rounds unless the user asks

If an optional participant fails repeatedly, skip it and note the gap
explicitly. If a required participant fails, times out, produces unparseable
output, or violates its evidence contract, mark it `invalid` or `failed` and
mark the run incomplete unless the user explicitly approves a weaker synthesis.

If the user pauses the run:

1. mark `status: "paused"`
2. note the reason in `notes`
3. do not spawn new agents
4. wait for in-flight agents to finish if practical
5. tell the user what remains

To resume:

1. read `state.json`
2. verify the run was paused or failed
3. re-open surviving agents if possible
4. continue from the last consistent checkpoint

## Research templates

The imported templates live in `TEMPLATES.md`.
Detailed execution plans live in `EXECUTION.md`.

The user can request a template by name, or the orchestrator can auto-select one.
If auto-selecting, briefly state which template was chosen and why before proceeding.
The user can override.

Template auto-selection:

| Task signal | Recommended template |
|-------------|---------------------|
| "verify my proof", "check this theorem", "stress-test", "find holes" | `Lakatos Proof and Refutation` |
| "attack this problem", "explore complexity", "is this hard or easy", "open problem" | `Polya Multi-Strategy Problem Solving` |
| "review my draft", "pre-submission review", "check exposition", "camera-ready" | `Knuth Structured Manuscript Review` |
| general math or TCS claim, algorithm analysis, combinatorial argument | `Structured Research Team` |
| token sliding, token jumping, gadget verification, reconfiguration, PSPACE reduction | `Graph Reconfiguration Specialist` |
| "formalize this lemma", "Lean proof", "fix this sorry", "formalization" | `Lean Formalization Team` |

If multiple templates match, prefer the more domain-specific one.

Template chaining is allowed when a task spans multiple concerns.
When chaining:

1. run one template per phase
2. pass only surviving claims and strongest proof skeletons forward
3. keep per-phase round files
4. state the planned chain before starting

## Mandatory rules for template runs

Before any template begins:

1. produce the plan output
2. restate the target claim in exact terms
3. list assumptions explicitly
4. separate what is given, to be proved, and conjectured
5. identify notation and definitions
6. obtain explicit user confirmation before launching any participants

Show this Step 0 restatement to the user before spawning agents for a high-stakes research template.

If a decisive counterexample or fatal gap is found:

1. stop defending the broken claim
2. switch to diagnosis
3. determine the strongest defensible corrected claim
4. do not keep expanding a broken proof across later rounds

## External verification in Codex

When a template calls for computational or formal checking, prefer:

- `sagemath` for heavy graph-theoretic or algebraic computation
- `graph-verifier` for lightweight graph checks
- `formal-skeleton-helper` for Lean-style scaffolding
- `functions.exec_command` for local scripts or test harnesses

Use the role-vs-orchestrator computation split from `EXECUTION.md` so verification stays independent when the template requires it.

If no external verification is possible, say so explicitly in the final ledger.

## Final output

Return a polished result with:

- Topic
- Mode
- Template used
- Roles used
- Models assigned
- Interaction pattern
- Rounds completed
- Main agreements
- Main disagreements
- Best points by role
- Final synthesis
- Recommended next step

Also include a compact run summary:

- run id
- profile used
- number of agents and their models
- reasoning efforts used
- rounds completed
- actual duration vs estimated duration
- whether recovery was needed
- whether any responses were truncated or models were swapped
- which progress checkpoint files were written

## Recommended templates

When this skill is involved, consider these workflow templates (install via
the `workflow-templates` artifact profile, or `--with-deps` to pull backing skills):

- `autonomous-research-loop-runbook` -- Bounded autonomous research-loop runbook with four stop conditions, single-path solving, mandatory cross-agent verification, fresh-agent backtracking, and Modal/GitHub Actions credit-gated heavy-compute offload.
- `cross-agent-adversarial-review` -- Producer-never-confirmer adversarial review of a paper, proof, or code artifact across agent families with a fresh-agent confirmation gate.
- `engineering-delivery-loop-runbook` -- Bounded build-and-deliver loop runbook: single-path implementation with seen-to-fail proof, cross-agent diff verification, behavior-preserving cleanup, and credit-gated heavy-compute offload.
